DOS2UNIX FOR MAC OSX
====================

Tired of those pesky ^M characters all over your sourcecode?
Working with windows and mac mixed teams?
Sick of commits from windows?
Porting old codebases from windows?
Wanna save some bytes?

Just a simple command line tool for converting line endings, nothing fancy

Just add to your $PATH and run it like this:

dos2unix badfile.txt
